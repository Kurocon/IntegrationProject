SAMPCA - Super Awesome Multi-Protocol Chat Application
==================

Integration Project for group 4

Starting
==================

To start the application, you have to compile it first with your favourite java compiler or IDE, and then run the sampca.SAMPCA class. This class can be found in src/sampca/SAMPCA.java. If all goes well, the login GUI should then pop up.

SETUP_SCRIPTS folder
==================
The archive contains two setup scripts we made using the provided script on Blackboard, to make logging in and out of the Ad-hoc network easier for us.

sampca.lua
==================
sampca.lua is a plugin for wireshark to help us to debug our networking protocol.
